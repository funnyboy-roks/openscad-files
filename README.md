# OpenSCAD Files

This is a collection of random things that I've modelled in [OpenSCAD]
for personal use.

[OpenSCAD]: https://openscad.org/

## Development

OpenSCAD may be opened in a window with automatic updates using

```sh
openscad --viewall <file.scad>
```

## Rendering

```sh
openscad <file.scad> -o <file.stl>
```
